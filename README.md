# sudoko-solver-game

A Sudoku solver employs various techniques to fill a 9x9 grid according to Sudoku rules. The primary techniques include:

# Backtracking: A depth-first search method that tries and backtracks on finding conflicts.

# Constraint Propagation: Reduces the possible values for each cell by propagating constraints.

# Exact Cover Algorithm (Dancing Links): Efficiently models and solves the problem as an exact cover problem.

These techniques can be combined to create robust and efficient Sudoku solvers, leveraging the simplicity of backtracking, the efficiency of constraint propagation, and the power of the exact cover algorithm.
